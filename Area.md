Calculating the Area of Each Triangle in Cephalometric Images:

The area of each triangle (abbreviated as Ar) was calculated using Heron's formula. The distances between the three points are measured using the distance algorithm and then divided by 2.

The following C# code calculates the area of each triangle based on Heron's formula. Then, simply follow the defined sequence to calculate the area of each triangle and store them in a list.

private double area(Point p1, Point p2, Point p3)
{
    // Calculate the sides of the triangle
    double a = Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(p1.X - p2.X, 2) + Math.Pow(p1.Y - p2.Y, 2));
    double b = Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(p2.X - p3.X, 2) + Math.Pow(p2.Y - p3.Y, 2));
    double c = Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(p3.X - p1.X, 2) + Math.Pow(p3.Y - p1.Y, 2));
    
    // Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle
    double S = (a + b + c) / 2;

    // Apply Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle
    double A = Math.Sqrt(S * (S - a) * (S - b) * (S - c));

    // Return the area of the triangle
    return A;
}



Another alternative method for calculating the area of a triangle uses the coordinates of the three points. The following code is a function called area that takes three points as input and calculates the area of the triangle formed by these points.
private double area(Point p1, Point p2, Point p3)
{
    int x1 = p1.X;
    int y1 = p1.Y;
    int x2 = p2.X;
    int y2 = p2.Y;
    int x3 = p3.X;
    int y3 = p3.Y;

    double k = ((y2 - y1) * (x3 - x1) - (x2 - x1) * (y3 - y1)) / ((y2 - y1) ^ 2 + (x2 - x1) ^ 2);
    double x4 = x3 - k * (y2 - y1);
    double y4 = y3 + k * (x2 - x1);

    float A1 = (float)y4 - y3;
    float B1 = x3 - (float)x4;
    float C1 = A1 * x3 + B1 * y3;

    float A2 = y2 - y1;
    float B2 = x1 - x2;
    float C2 = A2 * x1 + B2 * y1;

    // Get delta and check if the lines are parallel
    float delta = A1 * B2 - A2 * B1;
    if (delta == 0)
        return 0;

    double X = Math.Round((B2 * C1 - B1 * C2) / delta);
    double Y = Math.Round((A1 * C2 - A2 * C1) / delta);
    Point O = new Point((int)X, (int)Y);

    double h1 = Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(p3.X - O.X, 2) + Math.Pow(p3.Y - O.Y, 2));
    double A11 = Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(p1.X - p2.X, 2) + Math.Pow(p1.Y - p2.Y, 2));

    double h = Math.Round(h1, 1);
    double A = Math.Round(A11, 1);

    return A * h / 2;
}
