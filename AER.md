To execute the AER function, a Random object is first created. The Random class is used for generating random numbers. 
Then, a new list named shiftedPoints is defined to store points with shifted coordinates. 
In each iteration of the foreach loop, a random number in the range of -4 to +4 is generated for horizontal (X) displacement and a similar random number for vertical (Y) displacement. 
By adding the random numbers to the original coordinates of each point, a new point with shifted coordinates is created. 
The new X coordinate is equal to the sum of the original X coordinate and the random numbers, and the new Y coordinate is equal to the sum of the original Y coordinate and the random numbers.
The shifted point is then added to the shiftedPoints list. Thus, the shiftedPoints list contains points with randomly shifted coordinates. The value 4 is a default value and can be controlled by the operator in the software.


Random random = new Random();
List<Point> shiftedPoints = new List<Point>();

foreach (var point in points)
{
    int offsetX = random.Next(-4, 5); // Generate a random number in the range -4 to +4
    int offsetY = random.Next(-4, 5); // Generate a random number in the range -4 to +4

    Point shiftedPoint = new Point
    {
        X = point.X + offsetX,
        Y = point.Y + offsetY
    };

    shiftedPoints.Add(shiftedPoint);
}


After creating the list of new points, all calculations are repeated, and a new string is generated.
This new string is compared with the existing ones in the database, and the similarity value is obtained each time. 
If the similarity increases, the new coordinates replace the old ones. This process is repeated in a loop between 100 to 1000 times.
